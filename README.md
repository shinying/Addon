# Addon - Digital Post-it for Brainstroming

## Problem

Post-it help record and share ideas in an clear, organized, and flexible way, but the massive use of papers are double-edged sword. So What if we have digital notes in a mobile app which is specially designed for brainstorming?

## Solution

Add-on is an application composed of a mobile app and a website dedicated to create the experience of brainstoriming with post-it through digital device. The mobile app serves as notes with serveral input ways like typing or sketching. The [website](https://postwallapp.herokuapp.com) offering a wall to displaying all ideas for team members.

## Future Work

We often enhance our discussion with some techniques like voting or timing, so these features will be developed to complete the experience. Besides, Add-on could not only be a tool for teamwork but also a public platform for discussion on global or human issues where any creativity and comment could join. Thus, Add-on will need to include authorization control and the privacy of _walls_ could be dicided.
